# Simple Makefile for building examples.
# This will build the examples in the current directory by compiling in the
# full tskit source into each of the examples. This is *not* recommended for
# real projects!
#
# To use, type "make" in the this directory. If you have GSL installed you
# should then get two example programs built.
#
# **Note**: This repo uses git submodules, and these must be checked out
# correctly for this makefile to work, e.g.:
#
# $ git clone git@github.com:tskit-dev/tskit.git --recurse-submodules
#
# See the documentation (https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/c-api.html)
# for more details on how to use the C API, and the tskit build examples
# repo (https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit-build-examples) for examples
# of how to set up a production-ready build with tskit.
