[0.99.3] - 2019-XX-XX
---------------------

In development.

**New features**

- Add the ``TSK_KEEP_UNARY`` option to simplify (:user:`gtsambos`). See :issue:`1`
  and :pr:`143`.

---------------------
[0.99.2] - 2019-03-27
---------------------

Bugfix release. Changes:

- Fix incorrect errors on tbl_collection_dump (#132)
- Catch table overflows (#157)

---------------------
[0.99.1] - 2019-01-24
---------------------

Refinements to the C API as we move towards 1.0.0. Changes:

- Change the ``_tbl_`` abbreviation to ``_table_`` to improve readability.
  Hence, we now have, e.g., ``tsk_node_table_t`` etc.
- Change ``tsk_tbl_size_t`` to ``tsk_size_t``.
- Standardise public API to use ``tsk_size_t`` and ``tsk_id_t`` as appropriate.
- Add ``tsk_flags_t`` typedef and consistently use this as the type used to
  encode bitwise flags. To avoid confusion, functions now have an ``options``
  parameter.
- Rename ``tsk_table_collection_position_t`` to ``tsk_bookmark_t``.
- Rename ``tsk_table_collection_reset_position`` to ``tsk_table_collection_truncate``
  and ``tsk_table_collection_record_position`` to ``tsk_table_collection_record_num_rows``.
- Generalise ``tsk_table_collection_sort`` to take a bookmark as start argument.
- Relax restriction that nodes in the ``samples`` argument to simplify must
  currently be marked as samples. (https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/issues/72)
- Allow ``tsk_table_collection_simplify`` to take a NULL samples argument to
  specify "all samples in the current tables".
- Add support for building as a meson subproject.

---------------------

Initial alpha version of the tskit C API tagged. Version 0.99.x
represents the series of releases leading to version 1.0.0 which
will be the first stable release. After 1.0.0, semver rules
regarding API/ABI breakage will apply; however, in the 0.99.x
series arbitrary changes may happen.
