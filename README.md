The tree sequence toolkit

Please see the [documentation](https://tskit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for further details.

## Installation

The tree sequence toolkit is often installed to provide succinct tree sequence functionality to other software (such as [msprime](https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime)). If installing as a standalone Python module, users are encouraged to install an official release, e.g. via 

```
python3 -m pip install tskit
```

For technical reasons it is not possible to install a development version directly using the GitHub URL (i.e. `install git+git://...` will not work)
