Succinct tree sequences are a highly efficient way of storing a set of related DNA
sequences by encoding their ancestral history as a set of correlated trees along the
genome. The tree sequence format is output by a number of software libraries and programs
(such as [msprime](https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime),
[SLiM](https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM),
[fwdpp](http://molpopgen.github.io/fwdpp/), and
[tsinfer](https://tskit.dev/tsinfer/docs/stable/)) that either simulate or infer
the evolutionary history of genetic sequences. The evolutionary history of genetic
sequences is often technically referred to as an Ancestral Recombination Graph (ARG);
succinct tree sequences are fully compatible with this formulation, and tskit is a
therefore a powerful platform for processing ARGs.

The `tskit` library provides the underlying functionality used to load, examine, and
manipulate tree sequences, including efficient methods for calculating genetic
statistics. It often forms part of an installation of other software packages such as
those listed above. Please see the
[documentation](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/) for further details, which
includes
[installation instructions](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/installation.html).

To get started with tskit, tutorials and other content are at http://tskit.dev. For help
and support from the community you can use
[discussions](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/discussions) here on github, or raise an
issue for a specific bug or feature request.

We warmly welcome contributions from the community. Raise an issue if you have an
idea you'd like to work on, or submit a PR for comments and help.

The base `tskit` library provides both a [Python](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/python-api.html)
and [C](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/c-api.html) API. A Rust API is provided in the
[tskit-rust](https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit-rust) repository.


#### Python API
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/tskit.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/tskit/)
[![Supported Python Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/tskit.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/tskit/)
[![Wheel](https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/tskit)](https://pypi.org/project/tskit/)
[![Black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)


Most users of `tskit` will use the python API as it provides a convenient, high-level API
to access, analyse and create tree sequences. Full documentation is
[here](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/python-api.html).   

#### C API
[![C99](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C99-steelblue.svg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99)


The `tskit` C API provides comprehensive, low-level methods for manipulating and
processing tree-sequences. Written to the C99 standard and fully thread-safe, it can be
used with either C or C++. Full documentation is
[here](https://tskit.dev/tskit/docs/stable/c-api.html).
