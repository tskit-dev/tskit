--------------------
[0.X.X] - 2020-XX-XX
--------------------

**Features**

- ``Tree.newick()`` now has extra option ``include_branch_lengths`` to allow branch
  lengths to be omitted (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`931`).

- Added ``Tree.generate_star`` static method to create star-topologies (:user:`hyanwong`,
  :pr:`934`).

- Added ``equals`` method to TableCollection and each of the tables which
  provides more flexible equality comparisons, for example, allowing
  users to ignore metadata or provenance in the comparison.
  (:user:`mufernando`, :user:`jeromekelleher`, :issue:`896`, :pr:`897`,
  :issue:`913`, :pr:`917`).

- ``ts.dump`` and ``tskit.load`` now support reading and writing file objects such as
  FIFOs and sockets. (:user:`benjeffery`, :issue:`657`, :pr:`909`)

- Added ``tskit.write_ms`` for writing to MS format.
  (:user:`saurabhbelsare`, :issue:`727`, :pr:`854`)

- Added ``TableCollection.indexes`` for access to the edge insertion/removal order indexes.
  (:user:`benjeffery`, :issue:`4`, :pr:`916`)

- The dictionary representation of a TableCollection now contains its index.
  (:user:`benjeffery`, :issue:`870`, :pr:`921`)

- Added ``TreeSequence._repr_html_`` for use in jupyter notebooks.
  (:user:`benjeffery`, :issue:`872`, :pr:`923`)

**Breaking changes**

- The argument to ``ts.dump`` and ``tskit.load`` has been renamed `file` from `path`.
- All arguments to ``Tree.newick()`` except precision are now keyword-only.

--------------------
[0.3.2] - 2020-09-29
--------------------

**Breaking changes**

- Change several methods (``simplify()``, ``trees()``, ``Tree()``) so most parameters
  are keyword only, not positional. This allows reordering of parameters, so
  that deprecated parameters can be moved, and the parameter order in similar functions,
  e.g. ``TableCollection.simplify`` and ``TreeSequence.simplify()`` can be made
  consistent (:user:`hyanwong`, :issue:`374`, :issue:`846`, :pr:`851`)


**Features**

- Tree accessor functions (e.g. ``ts.first()``, ``ts.at()`` pass extra parameters such as
  ``sample_indexes`` to the underlying ``Tree`` constructor; also ``root_threshold`` can
  be specified when calling ``ts.trees()`` (:user:`hyanwong`, :issue:`847`, :pr:`848`)

- Genomic intervals returned by python functions are now namedtuples, allowing ``.left``
  ``.right`` and ``.span`` usage (:user:`hyanwong`, :issue:`784`, :pr:`786`, :pr:`811`)

- Added ``include_terminal`` parameter to edge diffs iterator, to output the last edges
  at the end of a tree sequence (:user:`hyanwong`, :issue:`783`, :pr:`787`)

- :issue:`832` - Add ``metadata_bytes`` method to allow access to raw
  TableCollection metadata (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`842`)

- New ``tree.is_isolated(u)`` method (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`443`).

- ``tskit.is_unknown_time`` can now check arrays. (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`857`).

--------------------
[0.3.1] - 2020-09-04
--------------------

**Bugfixes**

- :issue:`823` - Fix mutation time error when using
  ``simplify(keep_input_roots=True)`` (:user:`petrelharp`, :pr:`823`).

- :issue:`821` - Fix mutation rows with unknown time never being
  equal (:user:`petrelharp`, :pr:`822`).

--------------------
[0.3.0] - 2020-08-27
--------------------

Major feature release for metadata schemas, set-like operations, mutation times,
SVG drawing improvements and many others.

**Breaking changes**

- The default display order for tree visualisations has been changed to ``minlex``
  (see below) to stabilise the node ordering and to make trees more readily
  comparable. The old behaviour is still available with ``order="tree"``.

- File system operations such as dump/load now raise an appropriate OSError
  instead of ``tskit.FileFormatError``. Loading from an empty file now raises
  and ``EOFError``.

- Bad tree topologies are detected earlier, so that it is no longer possible
  to create a ``TreeSequence`` object which contains a parent with contradictory
  children on an interval. Previously an error was thrown when some operation
  building the trees was attempted (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :pr:`709`).

- The ``TableCollection object`` no longer implements the iterator protocol.
  Previously ``list(tables)`` returned a sequence of (table_name, table_instance)
  tuples. This has been replaced with the more intuitive and future-proof
  ``TableCollection.name_map`` and ``TreeSequence.tables_dict`` attributes, which
  perform the same function (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :issue:`500`,
  :pr:`694`).

- The arguments to ``TreeSequence.genotype_matrix``, ``TreeSequence.haplotypes``
  and ``TreeSequence.variants`` must now be keyword arguments, not positional. This
  is to support the change from ``impute_missing_data`` to ``isolated_as_missing``
  in the arguments to these methods. (:user:`benjeffery`, :issue:`716`, :pr:`794`)

**New features**

- New methods to perform set operations on TableCollections and TreeSequences.
  ``TableCollection.subset`` subsets and reorders table collections by nodes
  (:user:`mufernando`, :user:`petrelharp`, :pr:`663`, :pr:`690`).
  ``TableCollection.union`` forms the node-wise union of two table collections
  (:user:`mufernando`, :user:`petrelharp`, :issue:`381` :pr:`623`).

- Mutations now have an optional double-precision floating-point ``time`` column.
  If not specified, this defaults to a particular ``NaN`` value (``tskit.UNKNOWN_TIME``)
  indicating that the time is unknown. For a tree sequence to be considered valid
  it must meet new criteria for mutation times, see :ref:`sec_mutation_requirements`.
  Also added function ``TableCollection.compute_mutation_times``. Table sorting orders
  mutations by non-increasing time per-site, which is also a requirement for a valid tree
  sequence (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`672`).

- Add support for trees with internal samples for the Kendall-Colijn tree distance
  metric. (:user:`daniel-goldstein`, :pr:`610`)

- Add background shading to SVG tree sequences to reflect tree position along the
  sequence (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`563`).

- Tables with a metadata column now have a ``metadata_schema`` that is used to
  validate and encode metadata that is passed to ``add_row`` and decode metadata
  on calls to ``table[j]`` and e.g. ``tree_sequence.node(j)`` See :ref:`sec_metadata`
  (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`491`, :pr:`542`, :pr:`543`, :pr:`601`).

- The tree-sequence now has top-level metadata with a schema
  (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`666`, :pr:`644`, :pr:`642`).

- Add classes to SVG drawings to allow easy adjustment and styling, and document the new
  ``tskit.Tree.draw_svg()`` and ``tskit.TreeSequence.draw_svg()`` methods. This also fixes
  :issue:`467` for duplicate SVG entity ``id`` s in Jupyter notebooks
  (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`555`).

- Add a ``to_nexus`` function that outputs a tree sequence in Nexus format
  (:user:`saunack`, :pr:`550`).

- Add extension of Kendall-Colijn tree distance metric for tree sequences
  computed by ``TreeSequence.kc_distance``
  (:user:`daniel-goldstein`, :pr:`548`).

- Add an optional node traversal order in ``tskit.Tree`` that uses the minimum
  lexicographic order of leaf nodes visited. This ordering (``"minlex_postorder"``)
  adds more determinism because it constraints the order in which children of
  a node are visited (:user:`brianzhang01`, :pr:`411`).

- Add an ``order`` argument to the tree visualisation functions which supports
  two node orderings: ``"tree"`` (the previous default) and ``"minlex"``
  which stabilises the node ordering (making it easier to compare trees).
  The default node ordering is changed to ``"minlex"``
  (:user:`brianzhang01`, :user:`jeromekelleher`, :issue:`389`, :pr:`566`).

- Add ``_repr_html_`` to tables, so that jupyter notebooks render them as
  html tables (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`514`).

- Remove support for ``kc_distance`` on trees with unary nodes
  (:user:`daniel-goldstein`, :pr:`508`).

- Improve Kendall-Colijn tree distance algorithm to operate in O(n^2) time
  instead of O(n^2 * log(n)) where n is the number of samples
  (:user:`daniel-goldstein`, :pr:`490`).

- Add a metadata column to the migrations table. Works similarly to existing
  metadata columns on other tables (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`505`).

- Add a metadata column to the edges table. Works similarly to existing
  metadata columns on other tables (:user:`benjeffery`, :pr:`496`).

- Allow sites with missing data to be output by the ``haplotypes`` method, by
  default replacing with ``-``. Errors are no longer raised for missing data
  with ``isolated_as_missing=True``; the error types returned for bad alleles
  (e.g. multiletter or non-ascii) have also changed from ``_tskit.LibraryError``
  to TypeError, or ValueError if the missing data character clashes
  (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`426`).

- Access the number of children of a node in a tree directly using
  ``tree.num_children(u)`` (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`436`).

- User specified allele mapping for genotypes in ``variants`` and
  ``genotype_matrix`` (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :pr:`430`).

- New ``root_threshold`` option for the Tree class, which allows
  us to efficiently iterate over 'real' roots when we have
  missing data (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :pr:`462`).

- Add pickle support for ``TreeSequence`` (:user:`terhorst`, :pr:`473`).

- Add ``tree.as_dict_of_dicts()`` function to enable use with networkx. See
  :ref:`sec_tutorial_networkx` (:user:`winni2k`, :pr:`457`).

- Add ``tree_sequence.to_macs()`` function to convert tree sequence to MACS
  format (:user:`winni2k`, :pr:`727`)

- Add a ``keep_input_roots`` option to simplify which, if enabled, adds edges
  from the MRCAs of samples in the simplified tree sequence back to the roots
  in the input tree sequence (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :issue:`775`, :pr:`782`).

**Bugfixes**

- :issue:`453` - Fix LibraryError when ``tree.newick()`` is called with large node time
  values (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :pr:`637`).

- :issue:`777` - Mutations over isolated samples were incorrectly decoded as
  missing data. (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :pr:`778`)

- :issue:`776` - Fix a segfault when a partial list of samples
  was provided to the ``variants`` iterator. (:user:`jeromekelleher`, :pr:`778`)

**Deprecated**

- The ``sample_counts`` feature has been deprecated and is now
  ignored. Sample counts are now always computed.

- For ``TreeSequence.genotype_matrix``, ``TreeSequence.haplotypes``
  and ``TreeSequence.variants`` the ``impute_missing_data`` argument is deprecated
  and replaced with ``isolated_as_missing``. Note that to get the same behaviour
  ``impute_missing_data=True`` should be replaced with ``isolated_as_missing=False``.
  (:user:`benjeffery`, :issue:`716`, :pr:`794`)

--------------------
[0.2.3] - 2019-11-22
--------------------

Minor feature release, providing a tree distance metric and various
method to manipulate tree sequence data.

**New features**

- Kendall-Colijn tree distance metric computed by ``Tree.kc_distance``
  (:user:`awohns`, :pr:`172`).
- New "timeasc" and "timedesc" orders for tree traversals
  (:user:`benjeffery`, :issue:`246`, :pr:`399`).
- Up to 2X performance improvements to tree traversals (:user:`benjeffery`,
  :pr:`400`).
- Add ``trim``, ``delete_sites``, ``keep_intervals`` and ``delete_intervals``
  methods to edit tree sequence data. (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`364`,
  :pr:`372`, :pr:`377`, :pr:`390`).
- Initial online documentation for CLI (:user:`hyanwong`, :pr:`414`).
- Various documentation improvements (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`jeromekelleher`,
  :user:`petrelharp`).
- Rename the ``map_ancestors`` function to ``link_ancestors``
  (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`gtsambos`; :pr:`406`,
  :issue:`262`). The original function is retained as an deprecated alias.

**Bugfixes**

- Fix height scaling issues with SVG tree drawing (:user:`jeromekelleher`,
  :pr:`407`, :issue:`383`, :pr:`378`).
- Do not reuse buffers in ``LdCalculator`` (:user:`jeromekelleher`). See :pr:`397` and
  :issue:`396`.

--------------------
[0.2.2] - 2019-09-01
--------------------

Minor bugfix release.

Relaxes overly-strict input requirements on individual location data that
caused some SLiM tree sequences to fail loading in version 0.2.1
(see :issue:`351`).

**New features**

- Add log_time height scaling option for drawing SVG trees
  (:user:`marianne-aspbury`). See :pr:`324` and :issue:`303`.

**Bugfixes**

- Allow 4G metadata columns (:user:`jeromekelleher`). See :pr:`342` and
  :issue:`341`.


--------------------
[0.2.1] - 2019-08-23
--------------------

Major feature release, adding support for population genetic statistics,
improved VCF output and many other features.

**Note:** Version 0.2.0 was skipped because of an error uploading to PyPI
which could not be undone.

**Breaking changes**

- Genotype arrays returned by ``TreeSequence.variants`` and
  ``TreeSequence.genotype_matrix`` have changed from unsigned 8 bit values
  to signed 8 bit values to accomodate missing data (see :issue:`144` for
  discussion). Specifically, the dtype of the genotypes arrays have changed
  from numpy "u8" to "i8". This should not affect client code in any way
  unless it specifically depends on the type of the returned numpy array.

- The VCF written by the ``write_vcf`` is no longer compatible with previous
  versions, which had significant shortcomings. Position values are now rounded
  to the nearest integer by default, REF and ALT values are derived from the
  actual allelic states (rather than always being A and T). Sample names
  are now of the form ``tsk_j`` for sample ID j. Most of the legacy behaviour
  can be recovered with new options, however.

- The positional parameter ``reference_sets`` in ``genealogical_nearest_neighbours``
  and ``mean_descendants`` TreeSequence methods has been renamed to
  ``sample_sets``.

**New features**

- Support for general windowed statistics. Implementations of diversity,
  divergence, segregating sites, Tajima's D, Fst, Patterson's F statistics,
  Y statistics, trait correlations and covariance, and k-dimensional allele
  frequency specra (:user:`petrelharp`, :user:`jeromekelleher`, :user:`molpopgen`).

- Add the ``keep_unary`` option to simplify (:user:`gtsambos`). See :issue:`1`
  and :pr:`143`.

- Add the ``map_ancestors`` method to TableCollection (user:`gtsambos`). See :pr:`175`.

- Add the ``squash`` method to EdgeTable (:user:`gtsambos`). See :issue:`59` and
  :pr:`285`.

- Add support for individuals to VCF output, and fix major issues with output
  format (:user:`jeromekelleher`). Position values are transformed in a much
  more straightforward manner and output has been generalised substantially.
  Adds ``individual_names`` and ``position_transform`` arguments.
  See :pr:`286`, and issues :issue:`2`, :issue:`30` and :issue:`73`.

- Control height scale in SVG trees using 'tree_height_scale' and 'max_tree_height'
  (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`jeromekelleher`). See :issue:`167`, :pr:`168`.
  Various other improvements to tree drawing (:pr:`235`, :pr:`241`, :pr:`242`,
  :pr:`252`, :pr:`259`).

- Add ``Tree.max_root_time`` property (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`jeromekelleher`).
  See :pr:`170`.

- Improved input checking on various methods taking numpy arrays as parameters
  (:user:`hyanwong`). See :issue:`8` and :pr:`185`.

- Define the branch length over roots in trees to be zero (previously raise
  an error; :user:`jeromekelleher`). See :issue:`188` and :pr:`191`.

- Implementation of the genealogical nearest neighbours statistic
  (:user:`hyanwong`, :user:`jeromekelleher`).

- New ``delete_intervals`` and ``keep_intervals`` method for the TableCollection
  to allow slicing out of topology from specific intervals (:user:`hyanwong`,
  :user:`andrewkern`, :user:`petrelharp`, :user:`jeromekelleher`). See
  :pr:`225` and :pr:`261`.

- Support for missing data via a topological definition (:user:`jeromekelleher`).
  See :issue:`270` and :pr:`272`.

- Add ability to set columns directly in the Tables API (:user:`jeromekelleher`).
  See :issue:`12` and :pr:`307`.

- Various documentation improvements from :user:`brianzhang01`, :user:`hyanwong`,
  :user:`petrelharp` and :user:`jeromekelleher`.

**Deprecated**

- Deprecate ``Tree.length`` in favour of ``Tree.span`` (:user:`hyanwong`).
  See :pr:`169`.

- Deprecate ``TreeSequence.pairwise_diversity`` in favour of the new
  ``diversity`` method. See :issue:`215`, :pr:`312`.

**Bugfixes**

- Catch NaN and infinity values within tables (:user:`hyanwong`).
  See :issue:`293` and :pr:`294`.

--------------------
[0.1.5] - 2019-03-27
