Configuration and fixtures for pytest. Only put test-suite wide fixtures in here. Module
specific fixtures should live in their modules.

To use a fixture in a test simply refer to it by name as an argument. This is called
dependency injection. Note that all fixtures should have the suffix "_fixture" to make
it clear in test code.

For example to use the `ts` fixture (a tree sequence with data in all fields) in a test:

class TestClass:
    def test_something(self, ts_fixture):
        assert ts_fixture.some_method() == expected

Fixtures can be parameterised etc. see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/fixture.html

Note that fixtures have a "scope" for example `ts_fixture` below is only created once
per test session and re-used for subsequent tests.
