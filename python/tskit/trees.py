class Variant(SimpleContainer):
    """
    A variant represents the observed variation among samples
    for a given site. A variant consists (a) of a reference to the
    :class:`Site` instance in question; (b) the **alleles** that may be
    observed at the samples for this site; and (c) the **genotypes**
    mapping sample IDs to the observed alleles.

    Each element in the ``alleles`` tuple is a string, representing the
    actual observed state for a given sample. The ``alleles`` tuple is
    generated in one of two ways. The first (and default) way is for
    ``tskit`` to generate the encoding on the fly as alleles are encountered
    while generating genotypes. In this case, the first element of this
    tuple is guaranteed to be the same as the site's ``ancestral_state`` value
    and the list of alleles is also guaranteed not to contain any duplicates.
    Note that allelic values may be listed that are not referred to by any
    samples. For example, if we have a site that is fixed for the derived state
    (i.e., we have a mutation over the tree root), all genotypes will be 1, but
    the alleles list will be equal to ``('0', '1')``. Other than the
    ancestral state being the first allele, the alleles are listed in
    no particular order, and the ordering should not be relied upon
    (but see the notes on missing data below).

    The second way is for the user to define the mapping between
    genotype values and allelic state strings using the
    ``alleles`` parameter to the :meth:`TreeSequence.variants` method.
    In this case, there is no indication of which allele is the ancestral state,
    as the ordering is determined by the user.

    The ``genotypes`` represent the observed allelic states for each sample,
    such that ``var.alleles[var.genotypes[j]]`` gives the string allele
    for sample ID ``j``. Thus, the elements of the genotypes array are
    indexes into the ``alleles`` list. The genotypes are provided in this
    way via a numpy array to enable efficient calculations.

    When :ref:`missing data<sec_data_model_missing_data>` is present at a given
    site boolean flag ``has_missing_data`` will be True, at least one element
    of the ``genotypes`` array will be equal to ``tskit.MISSING_DATA``, and the
    last element of the ``alleles`` array will be ``None``. Note that in this
    case ``variant.num_alleles`` will **not** be equal to
    ``len(variant.alleles)``. The rationale for adding ``None`` to the end of
    the ``alleles`` list is to help code that does not handle missing data
    correctly fail early rather than introducing subtle and hard-to-find bugs.
    As ``tskit.MISSING_DATA`` is equal to -1, code that decodes genotypes into
    allelic values without taking missing data into account would otherwise
    output the last allele in the list rather missing data.

    A single tree in a :class:`TreeSequence`. Please see the
    :ref:`sec_tutorial_moving_along_a_tree_sequence` section for information
    on how efficiently access trees sequentially or obtain a list
    of individual trees in a tree sequence.

    The ``sample_lists`` parameter controls the features that are enabled
    for this tree. If ``sample_lists`` is True a more efficient algorithm is
    used in the :meth:`Tree.samples` method.

    The ``tracked_samples`` parameter can be used to efficiently count the
    number of samples in a given set that exist in a particular subtree
    using the :meth:`Tree.num_tracked_samples` method.

    The :class:`Tree` class is a state-machine which has a state
    corresponding to each of the trees in the parent tree sequence. We
    transition between these states by using the seek functions like
    :meth:`Tree.first`, :meth:`Tree.last`, :meth:`Tree.seek` and
    :meth:`Tree.seek_index`. There is one more state, the so-called "null"
    or "cleared" state. This is the state that a :class:`Tree` is in
    immediately after initialisation;  it has an index of -1, and no edges. We
    can also enter the null state by calling :meth:`Tree.next` on the last
    tree in a sequence, calling :meth:`Tree.prev` on the first tree in a
    sequence or calling calling the :meth:`Tree.clear` method at any time.

    The high-level TreeSequence seeking and iterations methods (e.g,
    :meth:`TreeSequence.trees`) are built on these low-level state-machine
    seek operations. We recommend these higher level operations for most
    users.

        The unicode format uses unicode `box drawing characters
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character>`_ to render the tree.
        This allows rendered trees to be printed out to the terminal::

            >>> print(tree.draw(format="unicode"))
              6

            ┃ ┃ ┏┻┓
            3 0 1 2

        The ``node_labels`` argument allows the user to specify custom labels
        for nodes, or no labels at all::

            >>> print(tree.draw(format="unicode", node_labels={}))

        Note: in some environments such as Jupyter notebooks with Windows or Mac,
        users have observed that the Unicode box drawings can be misaligned. In
        these cases, we recommend using the SVG or ASCII display formats instead.
        If you have a strong preference for aligned Unicode, you can try out the
        solution documented

            given in the map. Any nodes not specified in the map will take the default

            symbol is not plotted. (Only supported in the SVG format.)

            (specified by ID) that are present in the map. Any mutations not in the map
            will not have a label. (Showing mutations is currently only supported in the
            SVG format)
        :param dict mutation_colours: If specified, show custom colours for the mutations
            given in the map (specified by ID). As for ``node_colours``, mutations not
            present in the map take the default colour, and those mapping to ``None``
            are not drawn. (Only supported in the SVG format.)

            are 'svg', 'ascii' and 'unicode'.
        :param dict edge_colours: If specified, show custom colours for the edge
            joining each node in the map to its parent. As for ``node_colours``,
            unspecified edges take the default colour, and ``None`` values result in the
            edge being omitted. (Only supported in the SVG format.)

            If this is equal to ``"time"``, node heights are proportional to their time
            values. If this is equal to ``"log_time"``, node heights are proportional to
            their log(time) values. If it is equal to ``"rank"``, node heights are spaced
            equally according to their ranked times. For SVG output the default is
            'time'-scale whereas for text output the default is 'rank'-scale.
            Time scaling is not currently supported for text output.

            scaling system (see ``tree_height_scale``). Can be either a string or a
            numeric value. If equal to ``"tree"``, the maximum tree height is set to be
            that of the oldest root in the tree. If equal to ``"ts"`` the maximum
            height is set to be the height of the oldest root in the tree sequence;
            this is useful when drawing trees from the same tree sequence as it ensures
            that node heights are consistent. If a numeric value, this is used as the
            maximum tree height by which to scale other nodes. This parameters

        Given observations for the samples in this tree described by the specified
        set of genotypes and alleles, return a parsimonious set of state transitions
        explaining these observations. The genotypes array is interpreted as indexes
        into the alleles list in the same manner as described in the
        :meth:`TreeSequence.variants` method. Thus, if sample ``j`` carries the
        allele at index ``k``, then we have ``genotypes[j] = k``.
        Missing observations can be specified for a sample using the value
        ``tskit.MISSING_DATA`` (-1), in which case the state at this sample does not
        influence the ancestral state or the position of mutations returned. At least
        one non-missing observation must be provided. A maximum of 63 alleles are
        supported.

        The current implementation uses the Fitch parsimony algorithm to determine
        the minimum number of state transitions required to explain the data. In this
        model, transitions between any of the non-missing states is equally likely.

        The returned values correspond directly to the data model for describing
        variation at sites using mutations. See the :ref:`sec_site_table_definition`
        and :ref:`sec_mutation_table_definition` definitions for details and background.

        The state reconstruction is returned as two-tuple, ``(ancestral_state,
        mutations)``, where ``ancestral_state`` is the allele assigned to the
        tree root(s) and ``mutations`` is a list of :class:`Mutation` objects.
        For each mutation, ``node`` is the tree node at the bottom of the branch
        on which the transition occurred, and ``derived_state`` is the new state
        after this mutation. When multiple mutations are returned the ``parent``
        property contains the index of the previous mutation on the path to root
        (see the :ref:`sec_mutation_table_definition` for more information on the
        concept of mutation parents). All other attributes of the :class:`Mutation`
        object are undefined and should not be used.

        .. note::
            Sample states observed as missing in the input ``genotypes`` need
            not correspond to samples whose nodes are actually "missing" (i.e.
            :ref:`isolated<sec_data_model_missing_data>`) in the tree. In this
            case, mapping the mutations returned by this method onto the tree
            will result in these missing observations being imputed to the
            most parsimonious state.

    Parses the tree sequence data from the specified file-like objects, and
    returns the resulting :class:`TreeSequence` object. The format
    for these files is documented in the :ref:`sec_text_file_format` section,
    and is produced by the :meth:`TreeSequence.dump_text` method. Further
    properties required for an input tree sequence are described in the
    :ref:`sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements` section. This method is intended as a
    convenient interface for importing external data into tskit; the binary
    file format using by :meth:`tskit.load` is many times more efficient than
    this text format.

    The ``nodes`` and ``edges`` parameters are mandatory and must be file-like
    objects containing text with whitespace delimited columns,  parsable by
    :func:`parse_nodes` and :func:`parse_edges`, respectively. ``sites``,
    ``mutations``, ``individuals`` and ``populations`` are optional, and must
    be parsable by :func:`parse_sites`, :func:`parse_individuals`,
    :func:`parse_populations`, and :func:`parse_mutations`, respectively.

    TODO: there is no method to parse the remaining tables at present, so
    only tree sequences not requiring Population and Individual tables can
    be loaded. This will be fixed: https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime/issues/498

    The ``sequence_length`` parameter determines the
    :attr:`TreeSequence.sequence_length` of the returned tree sequence. If it
    is 0 or not specified, the value is taken to be the maximum right
    coordinate of the input edges. This parameter is useful in degenerate
    situations (such as when there are zero edges), but can usually be ignored.

    The ``strict`` parameter controls the field delimiting algorithm that
    is used. If ``strict`` is True (the default), we require exactly one
    tab character separating each field. If ``strict`` is False, a more relaxed
    whitespace delimiting algorithm is used, such that any run of whitespace
    is regarded as a field separator. In most situations, ``strict=False``
    is more convenient, but it can lead to error in certain situations. For
    example, if a deletion is encoded in the mutation table this will not
    be parseable when ``strict=False``.

    After parsing the tables, :meth:`TableCollection.sort` is called to ensure that
    the loaded tables satisfy the tree sequence :ref:`ordering requirements
    <sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements>`. Note that this may result in the
    IDs of various entities changing from their positions in the input file.

    :param io.TextIOBase nodes: The file-like object containing text describing a
        :class:`NodeTable`.
    :param io.TextIOBase edges: The file-like object containing text
        describing an :class:`EdgeTable`.

        describing a :class:`IndividualTable`.
    :param io.TextIOBase populations: The file-like object containing text
        describing a :class:`PopulationTable`.
    :param float sequence_length: The sequence length of the returned tree sequence. If
        not supplied or zero this will be inferred from the set of edges.

        """
        Returns an iterator over the variants in this tree sequence. See the
        :class:`Variant` class for details on the fields of each returned
        object. The ``genotypes`` for the variants are numpy arrays,
        corresponding to indexes into the ``alleles`` attribute in the
        :class:`Variant` object. By default, the ``alleles`` for each
        site are generated automatically, such that the ancestral state
        is at the zeroth index and subsequent alleles are listed in no
        particular order. This means that the encoding of alleles in
        terms of genotype values can vary from site-to-site, which is
        sometimes inconvenient. It is possible to specify a fixed mapping
        from allele strings to genotype values using the ``alleles``
        parameter. For example, if we set ``alleles=("A", "C", "G", "T")``,
        this will map allele "A" to 0, "C" to 1 and so on (the
        :data:`ALLELES_ACGT` constant provides a shortcut for this
        common mapping).

        By default, genotypes are generated for all samples. The ``samples``
        parameter allows us to specify the nodes for which genotypes are
        generated; output order of genotypes in the returned variants
        corresponds to the order of the samples in this list. It is also
        possible to provide **non-sample** nodes as an argument here, if you
        wish to generate genotypes for (e.g.) internal nodes. However,
        ``impute_missing_data`` must be True in this case, as it is not
        possible to detect missing data for non-sample nodes.

        If :ref:`missing data<sec_data_model_missing_data>` is present
        at a given site, the genotypes array will contain a special value
        :data:`MISSING_DATA` (-1) to identify these missing samples,
        and the ``alleles`` tuple will end with the value ``None``
        (note that this is true whether we specify a fixed mapping
        using the ``alleles`` parameter or not). See the :class:`Variant`
        class for more details on how missing data is reported.

        Missing data is reported by default, but if ``impute_missing_data``
        is set to to True, missing data will be imputed such that all
        isolated samples are assigned the ancestral state (unless they have
        mutations directly above them, in which case they will take the most
        recent derived mutational state for that node). This was the
        default behaviour in versions prior to 0.2.0.

        .. note::
            The ``as_bytes`` parameter is kept as a compatibility
            option for older code. It is not the recommended way of
            accessing variant data, and will be deprecated in a later
            release.

            as a Python bytes object. Legacy use only.

            isolated samples is the ancestral state; that is, we impute
            missing data as the ancestral state. Default: False.
        :param tuple alleles: A tuple of strings defining the encoding of
            alleles as integer genotype values. At least one allele must be provided.
            If duplicate alleles are provided, output genotypes will always be
            encoded as the first occurance of the allele. If None (the default),
            the alleles are encoded as they are encountered during genotype

        (see :ref:`sec_individual_table_definition`), the values for
        sample nodes associated with these individuals are combined
        into phased multiploid individuals and output.

        If there is no individual data present in the tree sequence, synthetic
        individuals are created by combining adjacent samples, and the number
        of samples combined is equal to the specified ploidy value (1 by
        default). For example, if we have a ploidy of 2 and a sample of size 6,
        then we will have 3 diploid samples in the output, consisting of the
        combined genotypes for samples [0, 1], [2, 3] and [4, 5]. If we had
        genotypes 011110 at a particular variant, then we would output the
        diploid genotypes 0|1, 1|1 and 1|0 in VCF.

        Each individual in the output is identified by a string; these are the
        VCF "sample" names. By default, these are of the form ``tsk_0``,
        ``tsk_1`` etc, up to the number of individuals, but can be manually
        specified using the ``individual_names`` argument. We do not check
        for duplicates in this array, or perform any checks to ensure that
        the output VCF is well-formed.

        The REF value in the output VCF is the ancestral allele for a site
        and ALT values are the remaining alleles. It is important to note,
        therefore, that for real data this means that the REF value for a given
        site **may not** be equal to the reference allele. We also do not
        check that the alleles result in a valid VCF---for example, it is possible
        to use the tab character as an allele, leading to a broken VCF.

        The ``position_transform`` argument provides a way to flexibly translate
        the genomic location of sites in tskit to the appropriate value in VCF.
        There are two fundamental differences in the way that tskit and VCF define
        genomic coordinates. The first is that tskit uses floating point values
        to encode positions, whereas VCF uses integers. Thus, if the tree sequence
        contains positions at non-integral locations there is an information loss
        incurred by translating to VCF. By default, we round the site positions
        to the nearest integer, such that there may be several sites with the
        same integer position in the output. The second difference between VCF
        and tskit is that VCF is defined to be a 1-based coordinate system, whereas
        tskit uses 0-based. However, how coordinates are transformed depends
        on the VCF parser, and so we do **not** account for this change in
        coordinate system by default.

        Example usage:

        .. code-block:: python

            with open("output.vcf", "w") as vcf_file:
                tree_sequence.write_vcf(vcf_file, ploidy=2)

        The VCF output can also be compressed using the :mod:`gzip` module, if you wish:

        .. code-block:: python

            import gzip

            with gzip.open("output.vcf.gz", "wt") as f:
                ts.write_vcf(f)

        However, this gzipped VCF may not be fully compatible with downstream tools
        such as tabix, which may require the VCF use the specialised bgzip format.
        A general way to convert VCF data to various formats is to pipe the text
        produced by ``tskit`` into ``bcftools``, as done here:

        .. code-block:: python

            import os
            import subprocess

            read_fd, write_fd = os.pipe()
            write_pipe = os.fdopen(write_fd, "w")
            with open("output.bcf", "w") as bcf_file:
                proc = subprocess.Popen(
                    ["bcftools", "view", "-O", "b"], stdin=read_fd, stdout=bcf_file
                )
                ts.write_vcf(write_pipe)
                write_pipe.close()
                os.close(read_fd)
                proc.wait()
                if proc.returncode != 0:
                    raise RuntimeError("bcftools failed with status:", proc.returncode)

        This can also be achieved on the command line use the ``tskit vcf`` command,
        e.g.:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ tskit vcf example.trees | bcftools view -O b > example.bcf

            length equal to the number of individuals to be output. Note that
            we do not check the form of these strings in any way, so that is
            is possible to output malformed VCF (for example, by embedding a
            tab character within on of the names). The default is to output
            ``tsk_j`` for the jth individual.
        :param position_transform: A callable that transforms the
            site position values into integer valued coordinates suitable for
            VCF. The function takes a single positional parameter x and must
            return an integer numpy array the same dimension as x. By default,
            this is set to ``numpy.round()`` which will round values to the
            nearest integer. If the string "legacy" is provided here, the
            pre 0.2.0 legacy behaviour of rounding values to the nearest integer
            (starting from 1) and avoiding the output of identical positions
            by incrementing is used.

        Then the summary function ``f`` is applied to the weights, giving a
        summary for each node in each tree. How this is then aggregated depends

        "site"
            Adds together the total summary value across all alleles in each window.

        "branch"
            Adds together the summary value for each node, multiplied by the

        This is a wrapper around :meth:`.general_stat` for the common case in
        which the weights are all either 1 or 0, i.e., functions of the joint
        allele frequency spectrum.
        See the :ref:`statistics interface <sec_stats_interface>` section for details on
        :ref:`sample sets <sec_stats_sample_sets>`,

        If ``sample_sets`` is a list of ``k`` sets of samples, then
        ``f`` should be a function that takes an argument of length ``k`` and
        returns a one-dimensional array. The ``j``-th element of the argument
        to ``f`` will be the number of samples in ``sample_sets[j]`` that lie
        below the node that ``f`` is being evaluated for. See
        :meth:`.general_stat`  for more details.

        Here is a contrived example: suppose that ``A`` and ``B`` are two sets
        of samples with ``nA`` and ``nB`` elements, respectively. Passing these
        as sample sets will give ``f`` an argument of length two, giving the number
        of samples in ``A`` and ``B`` below the node in question. So, if we define


        .. code-block:: python

            def f(x):
                pA = x[0] / nA
                pB = x[1] / nB
                return np.array([pA * pB])

        then if all sites are biallelic,

        .. code-block:: python

            ts.sample_count_stat([A, B], f, windows="site", polarised=False, mode="site")

        would compute, for each site, the product of the derived allele
        frequencies in the two sample sets, in a (num sites, 1) array.  If
        instead ``f`` returns ``np.array([pA, pB, pA * pB])``, then the
        output would be a (num sites, 3) array, with the first two columns
        giving the allele frequencies in ``A`` and ``B``, respectively.

        .. note::
            The summary function ``f`` should return zero when given both 0 and
            the sample size (i.e., ``f(0) = 0`` and
            ``f(np.array([len(x) for x in sample_sets]) = 0``).  This is
            necessary for the statistic to be unaffected by parts of the tree
            sequence ancestral to none or all of the samples, respectively.

            w is a column of W with the average subtracted off,
            and w[a] is the sum of all entries of w corresponding to samples
            carrying allele "a", and the first sum is over all alleles.

            The sum of squared covariances between the split induced by each branch and
            phenotypes, multiplied by branch length, averaged across trees in
            the window. This is computed as above: a branch with total weight
            w[b] below b contributes (branch length) * w[b]^2 to the total
            value for a tree. (Since the sum of w is zero, the total weight

        and see :ref:`sec_tutorial_afs` for examples of how to use this method.

        Similar to other windowed stats, the first dimension in the returned array
        corresponds to windows, such that ``result[i]`` is the AFS in the ith
        window. The AFS in each window is a k-dimensional numpy array, where k is
        the number of input sample sets, such that ``result[i, j0, j1, ...]`` is the
        value associated with frequency ``j0`` in ``sample_sets[0]``, ``j1`` in
        ``sample_sets[1]``, etc, in window ``i``. From here, we will assume that
        ``afs`` corresponds to the result in a single window, i.e.,
        ``afs = result[i]``.

        If a single sample set is specified, the allele frequency spectrum within
        this set is returned, such that ``afs[j]`` is the value associated with
        frequency ``j``. Thus, singletons are counted in ``afs[1]``, doubletons in
        ``afs[2]``, and so on. The zeroth entry counts alleles or branches not
        seen in the samples but that are polymorphic among the rest of the samples
        of the tree sequence; likewise, the last entry counts alleles fixed in
        the sample set but polymorphic in the entire set of samples. Please see
        the :ref:`sec_tutorial_afs_zeroth_entry` for an illustration.

        .. warning:: Please note that singletons are **not** counted in the initial
            entry in each AFS array (i.e., ``afs[0]``), but in ``afs[1]``.

        If ``sample_sets`` is None (the default), the allele frequency spectrum
        for all samples in the tree sequence is returned.

        If more than one sample set is specified, the **joint** allele frequency
        spectrum within windows is returned. For example, if we set
        ``sample_sets = [S0, S1]``, then afs[1, 2] counts the number of sites that
        at singletons within S0 and doubletons in S1. The dimensions of the
        output array will be ``[num_windows] + [1 + len(S) for S in sample_sets]``.

        If ``polarised`` is False (the default) the AFS will be *folded*, so that
        the counts do not depend on knowing which allele is ancestral. If folded,
        the frequency spectrum for a single sample set ``S`` has ``afs[j] = 0`` for
        all ``j > len(S) / 2``, so that alleles at frequency ``j`` and ``len(S) - j``
        both add to the same entry. If there is more than one sample set, the
        returned array is "lower triangular" in a similar way.

        What is computed depends on ``mode``:

        "site"
            The number of sites at a given frequency within the specified sample
            sets for each window, per unit of sequence length. To obtain the total
            number of sites, set ``span_normalise`` to False.

        "branch"
            The total length of branches in the trees subtended by subsets of the
            specified sample sets, per unit of sequence length. To obtain the
            total, set ``span_normalise`` to False.

        For example, consider a case with 2 sample sets, :math:`S_1` and :math:`S_2`.
        For a given tree, :math:`a` is the node that includes at least one descendant in
        :math:`S_1` or :math:`S_2` (not including the focal node). If the descendants of
        :math:`a` include some nodes in :math:`S_1` but no nodes in :math:`S_2`, then the
        GNN proportions for that tree will be 100% :math:`S_1` and 0% :math:`S_2`, or
        :math:`[1.0, 0.0]`.

        For a given focal node, the GNN proportions returned by this function are an
        average of the GNNs for each tree, weighted by the genomic distance spanned by
        that tree.

        For an precise mathematical definition of GNN, see https://doi.org/10.1101/458067

        .. note:: The reference sets need not include all the samples, hence the most
            recent common ancestral node of the reference sets, :math:`a`, need not be
            the immediate ancestor of the focal node. If the reference sets only comprise
            sequences from relatively distant individuals, the GNN statistic may end up
            as a measure of comparatively distant ancestry, even for tree sequences that
            contain many closely related individuals.

        .. warning:: The interface for this method is preliminary and may be subject to
            backwards incompatible changes in the near future. The long-term stable
            API for this method will be consistent with other :ref:`sec_stats`.

        :param list focal: A list of :math:`n` nodes whose GNNs should be calculated.
        :param list sample_sets: A list of :math:`m` lists of node IDs.
        :return: An :math:`n`  by :math:`m` array of focal nodes by GNN proportions.
            Every focal node corresponds to a row. The numbers in each
            row corresponding to the GNN proportion for each of the passed-in reference
            sets. Rows therefore sum to one.
