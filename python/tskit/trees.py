    mapping sample IDs to the observed alleles.

    Each element in the ``alleles`` tuple is a string, representing the
    actual observed state for a given sample. The first element of this
    tuple is guaranteed to be the same as the site's ``ancestral_state`` value.
    The list of alleles is also guaranteed not to contain any duplicates.
    However, allelic values may be listed that are not referred to by any
    samples. For example, if we have a site that is fixed for the derived state
    (i.e., we have a mutation over the tree root), all genotypes will be 1, but
    the alleles list will be equal to ``('0', '1')``. Other than the
    ancestral state being the first allele, the alleles are listed in
    no particular order, and the ordering should not be relied upon.

    The ``genotypes`` represent the observed allelic states for each sample,
    such that ``var.alleles[var.genotypes[j]]`` gives the string allele
    for sample ID ``j``. Thus, the elements of the genotypes array are
    indexes into the ``alleles`` list. The genotypes are provided in this

    A single tree in a :class:`.TreeSequence`. Please see the
    :ref:`sec_tutorial_moving_along_a_tree_sequence` section for information
    on how efficiently access trees sequentially or obtain a list
    of individual trees in a tree sequence.

    The ``sample_counts`` and ``sample_lists`` parameters control the
    features that are enabled for this tree. If ``sample_counts``
    is True, then it is possible to count the number of samples underneath
    a particular node in constant time using the :meth:`.num_samples`
    method. If ``sample_lists`` is True a more efficient algorithm is
    used in the :meth:`.Tree.samples` method.

    The ``tracked_samples`` parameter can be used to efficiently count the
    number of samples in a given set that exist in a particular subtree
    using the :meth:`.Tree.num_tracked_samples` method. It is an
    error to use the ``tracked_samples`` parameter when the ``sample_counts``
    flag is False.

    The :class:`.Tree` class is a state-machine which has a state
    corresponding to each of the trees in the parent tree sequence. We
    transition between these states by using the seek functions like
    :meth:`.Tree.first`, :meth:`.Tree.last`, :meth:`.Tree.seek` and
    :meth:`.Tree.seek_index`. There is one more state, the so-called "null"
    or "cleared" state. This is the state that a :class:`.Tree` is in
    immediately after initialisation;  it has an index of -1, and no edges. We
    can also enter the null state by calling :meth:`.Tree.next` on the last
    tree in a sequence, calling :meth:`.Tree.prev` on the first tree in a
    sequence or calling calling the :meth:`.Tree.clear` method at any time.

    The high-level TreeSequence seeking and iterations methods (e.g,
    :class:`.TreeSequence.trees`) are built on these low-level state-machine
    seek operations. We recommend these higher level operations for most
    users.

    Parses the tree sequence data from the specified file-like objects, and
    returns the resulting :class:`.TreeSequence` object. The format
    for these files is documented in the :ref:`sec_text_file_format` section,
    and is produced by the :meth:`.TreeSequence.dump_text` method. Further
    properties required for an input tree sequence are described in the
    :ref:`sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements` section. This method is intended as a
    convenient interface for importing external data into tskit; the binary
    file format using by :meth:`tskit.load` is many times more efficient than
    this text format.

    The ``nodes`` and ``edges`` parameters are mandatory and must be file-like
    objects containing text with whitespace delimited columns,  parsable by
    :func:`parse_nodes` and :func:`parse_edges`, respectively. ``sites``,
    ``mutations``, ``individuals`` and ``populations`` are optional, and must
    be parsable by :func:`parse_sites`, :func:`parse_individuals`,
    :func:`parse_populations`, and :func:`parse_mutations`, respectively.

    TODO: there is no method to parse the remaining tables at present, so
    only tree sequences not requiring Population and Individual tables can
    be loaded. This will be fixed: https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime/issues/498

    The ``sequence_length`` parameter determines the
    :attr:`.TreeSequence.sequence_length` of the returned tree sequence. If it
    is 0 or not specified, the value is taken to be the maximum right
    coordinate of the input edges. This parameter is useful in degenerate
    situations (such as when there are zero edges), but can usually be ignored.

    The ``strict`` parameter controls the field delimiting algorithm that
    is used. If ``strict`` is True (the default), we require exactly one
    tab character separating each field. If ``strict`` is False, a more relaxed
    whitespace delimiting algorithm is used, such that any run of whitespace
    is regarded as a field separator. In most situations, ``strict=False``
    is more convenient, but it can lead to error in certain situations. For
    example, if a deletion is encoded in the mutation table this will not
    be parseable when ``strict=False``.

    After parsing the tables, :func:`sort_tables` is called to ensure that
    the loaded tables satisfy the tree sequence :ref:`ordering requirements
    <sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements>`. Note that this may result in the
    IDs of various entities changing from their positions in the input file.

        The GNN proportions for a focal node in a single tree are given by first finding
        the most recent common ancestral node :math:`a` between the focal node and any
        other node present in the reference sets. The GNN proportion for a specific

        reference sets.

        For example, consider a case with 2 reference sets, :math:`S_1` and :math:`S_2`.
        For a given tree, :math:`a` is the node that includes at least one descendant in
        :math:`S_1` or :math:`S_2` (not including the focal node). If the descendants of
        :math:`a` include some nodes in :math:`S_1` but no nodes in :math:`S_2`, then the
        GNN proportions for that tree will be 100% :math:`S_1` and 0% :math:`S_2`, or
        :math:`[1.0, 0.0]`.

        For a given focal node, the GNN proportions returned by this function are an
        average of the GNNs for each tree, weighted by the genomic distance spanned by
        that tree.

        For an precise mathematical definition of GNN, see https://doi.org/10.1101/458067
