class Variant(SimpleContainer):

    A variant represents the observed variation among samples
    for a given site. A variant consists (a) of a reference to the
    :class:`.Site` instance in question; (b) the **alleles** that may be
    observed at the samples for this site; and (c) the **genotypes**
    mapping sample IDs to the observed alleles.

    Each element in the ``alleles`` tuple is a string, representing the
    actual observed state for a given sample. The first element of this
    tuple is guaranteed to be the same as the site's ``ancestral_state`` value.
    The list of alleles is also guaranteed not to contain any duplicates.
    However, allelic values may be listed that are not referred to by any
    samples. For example, if we have a site that is fixed for the derived state
    (i.e., we have a mutation over the tree root), all genotypes will be 1, but
    the alleles list will be equal to ``('0', '1')``. Other than the
    ancestral state being the first allele, the alleles are listed in
    no particular order, and the ordering should not be relied upon
    (but see the notes on missing data below).

    The ``genotypes`` represent the observed allelic states for each sample,
    such that ``var.alleles[var.genotypes[j]]`` gives the string allele
    for sample ID ``j``. Thus, the elements of the genotypes array are
    indexes into the ``alleles`` list. The genotypes are provided in this
    way via a numpy array to enable efficient calculations.

    When :ref:`missing data<sec_data_model_missing_data>` is present at a given
    site boolean flag ``has_missing_data`` will be True, at least one element
    of the ``genotypes`` array will be equal to ``tskit.MISSING_DATA``, and the
    last element of the ``alleles`` array will be ``None``. Note that in this
    case ``variant.num_alleles`` will **not** be equal to
    ``len(variant.alleles)``. The rationale for adding ``None`` to the end of
    the ``alleles`` list is to help code that does not handle missing data
    correctly fail early rather than introducing subtle and hard-to-find bugs.
    As ``tskit.MISSING_DATA`` is equal to -1, code that decodes genotypes into
    allelic values without taking missing data into account would otherwise
    output the last allele in the list rather missing data.

    A single tree in a :class:`.TreeSequence`. Please see the
    :ref:`sec_tutorial_moving_along_a_tree_sequence` section for information
    on how efficiently access trees sequentially or obtain a list
    of individual trees in a tree sequence.

    The ``sample_counts`` and ``sample_lists`` parameters control the
    features that are enabled for this tree. If ``sample_counts``
    is True, then it is possible to count the number of samples underneath
    a particular node in constant time using the :meth:`.num_samples`
    method. If ``sample_lists`` is True a more efficient algorithm is
    used in the :meth:`.Tree.samples` method.

    The ``tracked_samples`` parameter can be used to efficiently count the
    number of samples in a given set that exist in a particular subtree
    using the :meth:`.Tree.num_tracked_samples` method. It is an
    error to use the ``tracked_samples`` parameter when the ``sample_counts``
    flag is False.

    The :class:`.Tree` class is a state-machine which has a state
    corresponding to each of the trees in the parent tree sequence. We
    transition between these states by using the seek functions like
    :meth:`.Tree.first`, :meth:`.Tree.last`, :meth:`.Tree.seek` and
    :meth:`.Tree.seek_index`. There is one more state, the so-called "null"
    or "cleared" state. This is the state that a :class:`.Tree` is in
    immediately after initialisation;  it has an index of -1, and no edges. We
    can also enter the null state by calling :meth:`.Tree.next` on the last
    tree in a sequence, calling :meth:`.Tree.prev` on the first tree in a
    sequence or calling calling the :meth:`.Tree.clear` method at any time.

    The high-level TreeSequence seeking and iterations methods (e.g,
    :class:`.TreeSequence.trees`) are built on these low-level state-machine
    seek operations. We recommend these higher level operations for most
    users.

        model, transitions between any of the non-missing states is equally likely.

        The returned values correspond directly to the data model for describing

        The state reconstruction is returned as two-tuple, ``(ancestral_state,

        For each mutation, ``node`` is the tree node at the bottom of the branch
        on which the transition occurred, and ``derived_state`` is the new state
        after this mutation. When multiple mutations are returned the ``parent``

    Parses the tree sequence data from the specified file-like objects, and
    returns the resulting :class:`.TreeSequence` object. The format
    for these files is documented in the :ref:`sec_text_file_format` section,
    and is produced by the :meth:`.TreeSequence.dump_text` method. Further
    properties required for an input tree sequence are described in the
    :ref:`sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements` section. This method is intended as a
    convenient interface for importing external data into tskit; the binary
    file format using by :meth:`tskit.load` is many times more efficient than
    this text format.

    The ``nodes`` and ``edges`` parameters are mandatory and must be file-like
    objects containing text with whitespace delimited columns,  parsable by
    :func:`parse_nodes` and :func:`parse_edges`, respectively. ``sites``,
    ``mutations``, ``individuals`` and ``populations`` are optional, and must
    be parsable by :func:`parse_sites`, :func:`parse_individuals`,
    :func:`parse_populations`, and :func:`parse_mutations`, respectively.

    TODO: there is no method to parse the remaining tables at present, so
    only tree sequences not requiring Population and Individual tables can
    be loaded. This will be fixed: https://github.com/tskit-dev/msprime/issues/498

    The ``sequence_length`` parameter determines the
    :attr:`.TreeSequence.sequence_length` of the returned tree sequence. If it
    is 0 or not specified, the value is taken to be the maximum right
    coordinate of the input edges. This parameter is useful in degenerate
    situations (such as when there are zero edges), but can usually be ignored.

    The ``strict`` parameter controls the field delimiting algorithm that
    is used. If ``strict`` is True (the default), we require exactly one
    tab character separating each field. If ``strict`` is False, a more relaxed
    whitespace delimiting algorithm is used, such that any run of whitespace
    is regarded as a field separator. In most situations, ``strict=False``
    is more convenient, but it can lead to error in certain situations. For
    example, if a deletion is encoded in the mutation table this will not
    be parseable when ``strict=False``.

    After parsing the tables, :meth:`TableCollection.sort` is called to ensure that
    the loaded tables satisfy the tree sequence :ref:`ordering requirements
    <sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements>`. Note that this may result in the
    IDs of various entities changing from their positions in the input file.

        For a given tree, :math:`a` is the node that includes at least one descendant in

        Writes a VCF formatted file to the specified file-like object.
        If there is individual information present in the tree sequence
        (see :ref:`sec_individual_table_definition`), the values for
        sample nodes associated with these individuals are combined
        into phased multiploid individuals and output.

        If there is no individual data present in the tree sequence, synthetic
        individuals are created by combining adjacent samples, and the number
        of samples combined is equal to the specified ploidy value (1 by
        default). For example, if we have a ploidy of 2 and a sample of size 6,
        then we will have 3 diploid samples in the output, consisting of the
        combined genotypes for samples [0, 1], [2, 3] and [4, 5]. If we had
        genotypes 011110 at a particular variant, then we would output the
        diploid genotypes 0|1, 1|1 and 1|0 in VCF.

        Each individual in the output is identified by a string; these are the
        VCF "sample" names. By default, these are of the form ``tsk_0``,
        ``tsk_1`` etc, up to the number of individuals, but can be manually
        specified using the ``individual_names`` argument. We do not check
        for duplicates in this array, or perform any checks to ensure that
        the output VCF is well-formed.

        The REF value in the output VCF is the ancestral allele for a site
        and ALT values are the remaining alleles. It is important to note,
        therefore, that for real data this means that the REF value for a given
        site **may not** be equal to the reference allele. We also do not
        check that the alleles result in a valid VCF---for example, it is possible
        to use the tab character as an allele, leading to a broken VCF.

        The ``position_transform`` argument provides a way to flexibly translate
        the genomic location of sites in tskit to the appropriate value in VCF.
        There are two fundamental differences in the way that tskit and VCF define
        genomic coordinates. The first is that tskit uses floating point values
        to encode positions, whereas VCF uses integers. Thus, if the tree sequence
        contains positions at non-integral locations there is an information loss
        incurred by translating to VCF. By default, we round the site positions
        to the nearest integer, such that there may be several sites with the
        same integer position in the output. The second difference between VCF
        and tskit is that VCF is defined to be a 1-based coordinate system, whereas
        tskit uses 0-based. However, how coordinates are transformed depends
        on the VCF parser, and so we do **not** account for this change in
        coordinate system by default.

        Example usage:

        .. code-block:: python

            with open("output.vcf", "w") as vcf_file:
                tree_sequence.write_vcf(vcf_file, ploidy=2)

        The VCF output can also be compressed using the :mod:`gzip` module, if you wish:

        .. code-block:: python

            import gzip
            with gzip.open("output.vcf.gz", "wt") as f:
                ts.write_vcf(f)

        However, this gzipped VCF may not be fully compatible with downstream tools
        such as tabix, which may require the VCF use the specialised bgzip format.
        A general way to convert VCF data to various formats is to pipe the text
        produced by ``tskit`` into ``bcftools``, as done here:

        .. code-block:: python

            import os
            import subprocess

            read_fd, write_fd = os.pipe()
            write_pipe = os.fdopen(write_fd, "w")
            with open("output.bcf", "w") as bcf_file:
                proc = subprocess.Popen(
                    ["bcftools", "view", "-O", "b"], stdin=read_fd, stdout=bcf_file)
                ts.write_vcf(write_pipe)
                write_pipe.close()
                os.close(read_fd)
                proc.wait()
                if proc.returncode != 0:
                    raise RuntimeError("bcftools failed with status:", proc.returncode)

        This can also be achieved on the command line use the ``tskit vcf`` command,
        e.g.:

        .. code-block:: bash

            $ tskit vcf example.trees | bcftools view -O b > example.bcf

            length equal to the number of individuals to be output. Note that
            we do not check the form of these strings in any way, so that is
            is possible to output malformed VCF (for example, by embedding a
            tab character within on of the names). The default is to output

            this is set to :func:`numpy.round` which will round values to the
            nearest integer. If the string "legacy" is provided here, the
            pre 0.2.0 legacy behaviour of rounding values to the nearest integer

        instead ``f`` returns ``np.array([pA, pB, pA * pB])``, then the

        branch, or node and `w` is a column of W, there are :math:`k` columns of
        :math:`Z`, and the :math:`k+2`-vector :math:`b` minimises
        :math:`\\sum_i (w_i - b_0 - b_1 g_i - b_2 z_{2,i} - ... b_{k+2} z_{k+2,i})^2`
        then this returns the number :math:`b_1^2`. If :math:`g` lies in the linear span
        of the columns of :math:`Z`, then :math:`b_1` is set to 0.

        What is computed depends on ``mode``:

        "site"
            Computes the sum of :math:`b_1^2/2` for each allele in the window,
            as above with :math:`g` indicating presence/absence of the allele,
            then divided by the length of the window if ``span_normalise=True``.
            (For biallelic loci, this number is the same for both alleles, and so summing
            over each cancels the factor of two.)

        "branch"
            The squared coefficient `b_1^2`, computed for the split induced by each
            branch (i.e., with :math:`g` indicating inheritance from that branch),
            multiplied by branch length and tree span, summed over all trees
            in the window, and divided by the length of the window if
            ``span_normalise=True``.

        "node"
            For each node, the squared coefficient `b_1^2`, computed for the property of
            inheriting from this node, as in "branch".

        :param ndarray W: An array of values with one row for each sample and one column

        Computes the allele frequency spectrum (AFS) in windows across the genome for
        with respect to the specified ``sample_sets``. See :ref:`sec_general_stats` for
        details of ``windows``, ``mode``, ``span_normalise`` and ``polarised``,
        and see :ref:`sec_tutorial_afs` for examples of how to use this method.

        Similar to other windowed stats, the first dimension in the returned array
        corresponds to windows, such that ``result[i]`` is the AFS in the ith
        window. The AFS in each window is a k-dimensional numpy array, where k is
        the number of input sample sets, such that ``result[i, j0, j1, ...]`` is the
        value associated with frequency ``j0`` in ``sample_sets[0]``, ``j1`` in
        ``sample_sets[1]``, etc, in window ``i``. From here, we will assume that
        ``afs`` corresponds to the result in a single window, i.e.,
        ``afs = result[i]``.

        If a single sample set is specified, the allele frequency spectrum within
        this set is returned, such that ``afs[j]`` is the value associated with
        frequency ``j``. Thus, singletons are counted in ``afs[1]``, doubletons in
        ``afs[2]``, and so on. The zeroth entry counts alleles or branches not
        seen in the samples but that are polymorphic among the rest of the samples
        of the tree sequence; likewise, the last entry counts alleles fixed in
        the sample set but polymorphic in the entire set of samples. Please see
        the :ref:`sec_tutorial_afs_zeroth_entry` for an illustration.

        .. warning:: Please note that singletons are **not** counted in the initial
            entry in each AFS array (i.e., ``afs[0]``), but in ``afs[1]``.

        If ``sample_sets`` is None (the default), the allele frequency spectrum
        for all samples in the tree sequence is returned.

        If more than one sample set is specified, the **joint** allele frequency
        spectrum within windows is returned. For example, if we set
        ``sample_sets = [S0, S1]``, then afs[1, 2] counts the number of sites that
        at singletons within S0 and doubletons in S1. The dimensions of the
        output array will be ``[num_windows] + [1 + len(S) for S in sample_sets]``.

        If ``polarised`` is False (the default) the AFS will be *folded*, so that
        the counts do not depend on knowing which allele is ancestral. If folded,
        the frequency spectrum for a single sample set ``S`` has ``afs[j] = 0`` for
        all `j > len(S) / 2`, so that alleles at frequency ``j`` and ``len(S) - j``
        both add to the same entry. If there is more than one sample set, the
        returned array is "lower triangular" in a similar way.

        What is computed depends on ``mode``:

        "site"
            The number of sites at a given frequency within the specified sample
            sets for each window, per unit of sequence length. To obtain the total
            number of sites, set ``span_normalise`` to False.

        "branch"
            The total length of branches in the trees subtended by subsets of the
            specified sample sets, per unit of sequence length. To obtain the
            total, set ``span_normalise`` to False.

            The average density of sites at which ``a`` and ``c`` agree but
            differs from ``b`` and ``d``, minus the average density of sites at
            which ``a`` and ``d`` agree but differs from ``b`` and ``c``, per
            unit of chromosome length.

        "branch"
            The average length of all branches that separate ``a`` and ``c``
            from ``b`` and ``d``, minus the average length of all branches that
            separate ``a`` and ``d`` from ``b`` and ``c`` (in units of time).

        "node"
            For each node, the average proportion of the window on which ``a`` and ``c``
            inherit from that node but ``b`` and ``d`` do not, or vice-versa,
            minus the average proportion of the window on which ``a`` anc ``d``
            inherit from that node but ``b`` and ``c`` do not, or vice-versa.
