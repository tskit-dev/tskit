    A single tree in a :class:`TreeSequence`. Please see the
    :ref:`tutorials:sec_processing_trees` section for information
    on how efficiently access trees sequentially or obtain a list
    of individual trees in a tree sequence.

    The ``sample_lists`` parameter controls the features that are enabled
    for this tree. If ``sample_lists`` is True a more efficient algorithm is
    used in the :meth:`Tree.samples` method.

    The ``tracked_samples`` parameter can be used to efficiently count the
    number of samples in a given set that exist in a particular subtree
    using the :meth:`Tree.num_tracked_samples` method.

    The :class:`Tree` class is a state-machine which has a state
    corresponding to each of the trees in the parent tree sequence. We
    transition between these states by using the seek functions like
    :meth:`Tree.first`, :meth:`Tree.last`, :meth:`Tree.seek` and
    :meth:`Tree.seek_index`. There is one more state, the so-called "null"
    or "cleared" state. This is the state that a :class:`Tree` is in
    immediately after initialisation;  it has an index of -1, and no edges. We
    can also enter the null state by calling :meth:`Tree.next` on the last
    tree in a sequence, calling :meth:`Tree.prev` on the first tree in a
    sequence or calling calling the :meth:`Tree.clear` method at any time.

    The high-level TreeSequence seeking and iterations methods (e.g,
    :meth:`TreeSequence.trees`) are built on these low-level state-machine
    seek operations. We recommend these higher level operations for most
    users.

    :param TreeSequence tree_sequence: The parent tree sequence.
    :param list tracked_samples: The list of samples to be tracked and
        counted using the :meth:`Tree.num_tracked_samples` method.
    :param bool sample_lists: If True, provide more efficient access
        to the samples beneath a give node using the
        :meth:`Tree.samples` method.
    :param int root_threshold: The minimum number of samples that a node
        must be ancestral to for it to be in the list of roots. By default
        this is 1, so that isolated samples (representing missing data)
        are roots. To efficiently restrict the roots of the tree to
        those subtending meaningful topology, set this to 2. This value
        is only relevant when trees have multiple roots.

            plotting symbols. If ``None`` (default) use a standard size.
        :param bool x_axis: Should the plot have an X axis line, showing the start and
            end position of this tree along the genome. If ``None`` (default) do not

            and there is a Y axis,  create and place an appropriate label.
        :param list y_ticks: A list of Y values at which to plot tickmarks (``[]``
            gives no tickmarks). If ``None``, plot one tickmark for each unique
            node value.
        :param bool y_gridlines: Whether to plot horizontal lines behind the tree
            at each y tickmark.
        :param bool all_edge_mutations: The edge on which a mutation occurs may span
            multiple trees. If ``False`` or ``None`` (default) mutations are only drawn
            on an edge if their site position exists within the genomic interval covered
            by this tree. If ``True``, all mutations on each edge of the tree are drawn,
            even if their genomic position is to the left or right of the tree
            itself. Note that this means that independent drawings of different trees
            from the same tree sequence may share some plotted mutations.

        function to display the SVG output from this function inline in the notebook::

        The unicode format uses unicode `box drawing characters
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_character>`_ to render the tree.
        This allows rendered trees to be printed out to the terminal::

            >>> print(tree.draw(format="unicode"))

            3 0 1 2

        The ``node_labels`` argument allows the user to specify custom labels
        for nodes, or no labels at all::

        Note: in some environments such as Jupyter notebooks with Windows or Mac,
        users have observed that the Unicode box drawings can be misaligned. In
        these cases, we recommend using the SVG or ASCII display formats instead.

        .. note::
            Unlike the :meth:`TreeSequence.nodes` method, this iterator produces
            integer node IDs, not :class:`Node` objects.

        If the ``root`` parameter is not provided or ``None``, iterate over all
        nodes reachable from the roots (see :attr:`Tree.roots` for details
        on which nodes are considered roots). If the ``root`` parameter
        is provided, only the nodes in the subtree rooted at this node
        (including the specified node) will be iterated over. If the
        :attr:`.virtual_root` is specified as the traversal root, it will
        be included in the traversed nodes in the appropriate position
        for the given ordering. (See the
        :ref:`tree roots <sec_data_model_tree_virtual_root>` section for more
        information on the virtual root.)

        The ``order`` parameter defines the order in which tree nodes are visited
        in the iteration (also see the :ref:`sec_analysing_trees_traversals` section
        in the `tutorials <https://tskit.dev/tutorials>`__). The available orders are:

        - 'preorder': starting at root, yield the current node, then recurse
          and do a preorder on each child of the current node. See also `Wikipedia
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order_(NLR)>`__.
        - 'inorder': starting at root, assuming binary trees, recurse and do
          an inorder on the first child, then yield the current node, then
          recurse and do an inorder on the second child. In the case of ``n``
          child nodes (not necessarily 2), the first ``n // 2`` children are
          visited in the first stage, and the remaining ``n - n // 2`` children
          are visited in the second stage. See also `Wikipedia
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order_(LNR)>`__.
        - 'postorder': starting at root, recurse and do a postorder on each
          child of the current node, then yield the current node. See also
          `Wikipedia
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Post-order_(LRN)>`__.
        - 'levelorder' ('breadthfirst'): visit the nodes under root (including
          the root) in increasing order of their depth from root. See also
          `Wikipedia
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal\
#Breadth-first_search_/_level_order>`__.
        - 'timeasc': visits the nodes in order of increasing time, falling back to
          increasing ID if times are equal.
        - 'timedesc': visits the nodes in order of decreasing time, falling back to
          decreasing ID if times are equal.
        - 'minlex_postorder': a usual postorder has ambiguity in the order in
          which children of a node are visited. We constrain this by outputting
          a postorder such that the leaves visited, when their IDs are
          listed out, have minimum `lexicographic order
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order>`__ out of all valid
          traversals. This traversal is useful for drawing multiple trees of
          a ``TreeSequence``, as it leads to more consistency between adjacent
          trees. Note that internal non-leaf nodes are not counted in
          assessing the lexicographic order.

        encodes as::

            (n0:2,(n1:1,n2:1):1);

        By default :ref:`sample nodes<sec_data_model_definitions>` are
        labelled using the form ``f"n{node_id}"``, i.e. the sample node's
        ID prefixed with the string ``"n"``. Node labels can be specified
        explicitly using the ``node_labels`` argument, which is a mapping from
        integer node IDs to the corresponding string label. If a node is not
        present in the mapping, no label is associated with the node in
        output.

        .. warning:: Node labels are **not** Newick escaped, so care must be taken
            to provide labels that will not break the encoding.

        .. note:: Specifying a ``node_labels`` dictionary or setting
            ``include_branch_lengths=False`` results in a less efficient
            method being used to generate the newick output. The performance
            difference can be substantial for large trees.

        By default, branch lengths are printed out with sufficient precision
        for them to be recovered exactly in double precision (although note
        that this does not necessarily mean that we can precisely recover the
        corresponding node times, since branch lengths are obtained by
        subtraction). If all times on the tree sequence are discrete, then
        branch lengths are printed as integers. Otherwise, branch lengths are
        printed with 17 digits of precision (i.e., ``"%.17f"`` in
        printf-notation).

        The precision for branch lengths can be specified using the ``precision``
        argument. Branch lengths can be omitted entirely by setting
        ``include_branch_lengths=False``.

        If the ``root`` argument is specified, we return the newick encoding of

        has :ref:`multiple roots <sec_data_model_tree_roots>` and a root node
        is not explicitly specified, we raise a ``ValueError``. This is because
        most libraries and downstream software consider a newick string that
        contains multiple disconnected subtrees an error, and it is therefore
        best to consider how such topologies should be interchanged on a
        case-by-base basis. A list of the newick strings for each root can be

        used to mimic the output of the ``ms`` simulator. However, the choice

        Given observations for the samples in this tree described by the specified
        set of genotypes and alleles, return a parsimonious set of state transitions
        explaining these observations. The genotypes array is interpreted as indexes
        into the alleles list in the same manner as described in the
        :meth:`TreeSequence.variants` method. Thus, if sample ``j`` carries the
        allele at index ``k``, then we have ``genotypes[j] = k``.
        Missing observations can be specified for a sample using the value
        ``tskit.MISSING_DATA`` (-1), in which case the state at this sample does not
        influence the ancestral state or the position of mutations returned. At least
        one non-missing observation must be provided. A maximum of 64 alleles are
        supported.

        The current implementation uses the Hartigan parsimony algorithm to determine
        the minimum number of state transitions required to explain the data. In this
        model, transitions between any of the non-missing states is equally likely.

        The returned values correspond directly to the data model for describing
        variation at sites using mutations. See the :ref:`sec_site_table_definition`
        and :ref:`sec_mutation_table_definition` definitions for details and background.

        The state reconstruction is returned as two-tuple, ``(ancestral_state,
        mutations)``, where ``ancestral_state`` is the allele assigned to the
        tree root(s) and ``mutations`` is a list of :class:`Mutation` objects,
        ordered as :ref:`required in a mutation table<sec_mutation_requirements>`.
        For each mutation, ``derived_state`` is the new state after this mutation and
        ``node`` is the tree node immediately beneath the mutation (if there are unary
        nodes between two branch points, hence multiple nodes above which the
        mutation could be parsimoniously placed, the oldest node is used). The
        ``parent`` property contains the index in the returned list of the previous
        mutation on the path to root, or ``tskit.NULL``
        if there are no previous mutations (see the :ref:`sec_mutation_table_definition`
        for more information on the concept of mutation parents). All other attributes
        of the :class:`Mutation` object are undefined and should not be used.

        .. note::
            Sample states observed as missing in the input ``genotypes`` need
            not correspond to samples whose nodes are actually "missing" (i.e.,
            :ref:`isolated<sec_data_model_missing_data>`) in the tree. In this
            case, mapping the mutations returned by this method onto the tree
            will result in these missing observations being imputed to the
            most parsimonious state.

        See the :ref:`tutorials:sec_analysing_trees_parsimony` section in the tutorial
        for examples of how to use this method.

            an ancestral state is chosen arbitrarily from among those that provide
            the most parsimonious placement of mutations. Note that if the ancestral
            state is specified, the placement of mutations may not be as parsimonious
            as that which could be achieved by leaving the ancestral state unspecified;
            additionally it may lead to mutations being placed above the root node(s) of

    Return a :class:`TreeSequence` instance parsed from tabulated text data
    contained in the specified file-like objects. The format
    for these files is documented in the :ref:`sec_text_file_format` section,
    and is produced by the :meth:`TreeSequence.dump_text` method. Further
    properties required for an input tree sequence are described in the
    :ref:`sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements` section. This method is intended as a
    convenient interface for importing external data into tskit; the binary
    file format using by :meth:`tskit.load` is many times more efficient than
    this text format.

    The ``nodes`` and ``edges`` parameters are mandatory and must be file-like
    objects containing text with whitespace delimited columns,  parsable by
    :func:`parse_nodes` and :func:`parse_edges`, respectively. ``sites``,
    ``individuals``, ``populations``, ``mutations``, and ``migrations`` are optional,
    and must be parsable by :func:`parse_sites`, :func:`parse_individuals`,
    :func:`parse_populations`, :func:`parse_mutations`, and :func:`parse_migrations`,
    respectively. For convenience, if the node table refers to populations,
    but the ``populations`` parameter is not provided, a minimal set of rows are
    added to the population table, so that a valid tree sequence can be returned.

    The ``sequence_length`` parameter determines the
    :attr:`TreeSequence.sequence_length` of the returned tree sequence. If it
    is 0 or not specified, the value is taken to be the maximum right
    coordinate of the input edges. This parameter is useful in degenerate
    situations (such as when there are zero edges), but can usually be ignored.

    The ``strict`` parameter controls the field delimiting algorithm that
    is used. If ``strict`` is True (the default), we require exactly one
    tab character separating each field. If ``strict`` is False, a more relaxed
    whitespace delimiting algorithm is used, such that any run of whitespace
    is regarded as a field separator. In most situations, ``strict=False``
    is more convenient, but it can lead to error in certain situations. For
    example, if a deletion is encoded in the mutation table this will not
    be parseable when ``strict=False``.

    After parsing the tables, :meth:`TableCollection.sort` is called to ensure that
    the loaded tables satisfy the tree sequence :ref:`ordering requirements
    <sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements>`. Note that this may result in the
    IDs of various entities changing from their positions in the input file.

        the tree sequence. Each iteration yields a named tuple consisting of 3 values,
        ``(interval, edges_out, edges_in)``. The first value, ``interval``, is the
        genomic interval ``(left, right)`` covered by the incoming tree
        (see :attr:`Tree.interval`). The second, ``edges_out`` is a list of the edges
        that were just-removed to create the tree covering the interval
        (hence ``edges_out`` will always be empty for the first tree). The last value,
        ``edges_in``, is a list of edges that were just
        inserted to construct the tree covering the current interval.

        The edges returned within each ``edges_in`` list are ordered by ascending
        time of the parent node, then ascending parent id, then ascending child id.
        The edges within each ``edges_out`` list are the reverse order (e.g.
        descending parent time, parent id, then child_id). This means that within
        each list, edges with the same parent appear consecutively.

        The ``direction`` argument can be used to control whether diffs are produced

        The alleles at each site must be represented by single byte characters,

        Returns an iterator over the variants between the ``left`` (inclusive)
        and ``right`` (exclusive) genomic positions in this tree sequence. Each
        returned :class:`Variant` object has a site, a list of possible allelic
        states and an array of genotypes for the specified ``samples``. The
        ``genotypes`` value is a numpy array containing indexes into the
        ``alleles`` list. By default, this list is generated automatically for
        each site such that the first entry, ``alleles[0]``, is the ancestral
        state and subsequent alleles are listed in no
        particular order. This means that the encoding of alleles in
        terms of genotype values can vary from site-to-site, which is
        sometimes inconvenient. It is possible to specify a fixed mapping
        from allele strings to genotype values using the ``alleles``
        parameter. For example, if we set ``alleles=("A", "C", "G", "T")``,
        this will map allele "A" to 0, "C" to 1 and so on (the
        :data:`ALLELES_ACGT` constant provides a shortcut for this
        common mapping).

        By default, genotypes are generated for all samples. The ``samples``
        parameter allows us to specify the nodes for which genotypes are
        generated; output order of genotypes in the returned variants
        corresponds to the order of the samples in this list. It is also
        possible to provide **non-sample** nodes as an argument here, if you
        wish to generate genotypes for (e.g.) internal nodes. However,
        ``isolated_as_missing`` must be False in this case, as it is not
        possible to detect missing data for non-sample nodes.

        If isolated samples are present at a given site without mutations above them,
        they are interpreted by default as
        :ref:`missing data<sec_data_model_missing_data>`, and the genotypes array
        will contain a special value :data:`MISSING_DATA` (-1) to identify them
        while the ``alleles`` tuple will end with the value ``None`` (note that this
        will be the case whether or not we specify a fixed mapping using the
        ``alleles`` parameter; see the :class:`Variant` class for more details).
        Alternatively, if ``isolated_as_missing`` is set to to False, such isolated
        samples will not be treated as missing, and instead assigned the ancestral
        state (this was the default behaviour in versions prior to 0.2.0). Prior to
        0.3.0 the `impute_missing_data` argument controlled this behaviour.

            coordinate space. Care will be needed when interacting with other
            libraries and upstream coordinate spaces.


        The :ref:`sites<sec_data_model_definitions_site>` in a tree sequence will
        usually only define the variation for a subset of the ``L`` nucleotide
        positions along the genome, and the remaining positions are filled using
        a :ref:`reference sequence <sec_data_model_reference_sequence>`.
        The reference sequence data is defined either via the
        ``reference_sequence`` parameter to this method, or embedded within
        with the tree sequence itself via the :attr:`.TreeSequence.reference_sequence`.

        Site information from the tree sequence takes precedence over the reference
        sequence so that, for example, at a site with no mutations all samples
        will have the site's ancestral state.

        The reference sequence bases are determined in the following way:

        - If the ``reference_sequence`` parameter is supplied this will be
          used, regardless of whether the tree sequence has an embedded
          reference sequence.
        - Otherwise, if the tree sequence has an embedded reference sequence,
          this will be used.
        - If the ``reference_sequence`` parameter is not specified and
          there is no embedded reference sequence, ``L`` copies of the
          ``missing_data_character`` (which defaults to 'N') are used
          instead.

        .. warning:: The :class:`.ReferenceSequence` API is preliminary and
           some behaviours may change in the future. In particular, a
           tree sequence is currently regarded as having an embedded reference
           sequence even if it only has some metadata defined. In this case
           the ``reference_sequence`` parameter will need to be explicitly set.

        .. note::
            Two common options for setting a reference sequence are:

            - Mark them as missing data, by setting
              ``reference_sequence="N" * int(ts.sequence_length)``
            - Fill the gaps with random nucleotides, by setting
              ``reference_sequence=tskit.random_nucleotides(ts.sequence_length)``.
              See the :func:`.random_nucleotides` function for more information.

        .. warning:: Insertions and deletions are not currently supported and
           the alleles at each site must be represented by
           single byte characters, (i.e., variants must be single nucleotide
           polymorphisms, or SNPs).

        .. warning:: :ref:`Missing data<sec_data_model_missing_data>` is not
           currently supported by this method and it will raise a ValueError

        .. seealso: See the :ref:`sec_export_vcf` section for examples
            and explanations of how we map VCF to the tskit data model.

        Multiploid samples in the output VCF are generated either using
        individual information in the data model (see
        :ref:`sec_individual_table_definition`), or by combining genotypes for
        adjacent sample nodes using the ``ploidy`` argument. See the
        :ref:`sec_export_vcf_constructing_gt` section for more details
        and examples.

        If individuals that are associated with sample nodes are defined in the
        data model (see :ref:`sec_individual_table_definition`), the genotypes
        for each of the individual's samples are combined into a phased
        multiploid values at each site. By default, all individuals associated
        with sample nodes are included in increasing order of individual ID.

        Subsets or permutations of the sample individuals may be specified
        using the ``individuals`` argument. It is an error to specify any
        individuals that are not associated with any nodes, or whose
        nodes are not all samples.

        Mixed-sample individuals (e.g., those associated with one node
        that is a sample and another that is not) in the data model will
        result in an error by default. However, such individuals can be
        excluded using the ``individuals`` argument.

        If there are no individuals in the tree sequence,
        synthetic individuals are created by combining adjacent samples, and
        the number of samples combined is equal to the ``ploidy`` value (1 by
        default). For example, if we have a ``ploidy`` of 2 and 6 sample nodes,
        then we will have 3 diploid samples in the VCF, consisting of the
        combined genotypes for samples [0, 1], [2, 3] and [4, 5]. If we had
        genotypes 011110 at a particular variant, then we would output the
        diploid genotypes 0|1, 1|1 and 1|0 in VCF.

        Each individual in the output is identified by a string; these are the
        VCF "sample" names. By default, these are of the form ``tsk_0``,
        ``tsk_1`` etc, up to the number of individuals, but can be manually
        specified using the ``individual_names`` argument. We do not check
        for duplicates in this array, or perform any checks to ensure that
        the output VCF is well-formed.

        .. note::
            The default individual names (VCF sample IDs) are always of
            the form ``tsk_0``, ``tsk_1``, ..., ``tsk_{N - 1}``, where
            N is the number of individuals we output. These numbers
            are **not** necessarily the individual IDs.

        The REF value in the output VCF is the ancestral allele for a site
        and ALT values are the remaining alleles. It is important to note,
        therefore, that for real data this means that the REF value for a given
        site **may not** be equal to the reference allele. We also do not
        check that the alleles result in a valid VCF---for example, it is possible
        to use the tab character as an allele, leading to a broken VCF.

        The ID value in the output VCF file is the integer ID of the
        corresponding :ref:`site <sec_site_table_definition>` (``site.id``).
        These ID values can be utilized to match the contents of the VCF file
        to the sites in the tree sequence object.

        .. note::
           Older code often uses the ``ploidy=2`` argument, because old
           versions of msprime did not output individual data. Specifying
           individuals in the tree sequence is more robust, and since tree
           sequences now  typically contain individuals (e.g., as produced by
           ``msprime.sim_ancestry( )``), this is not necessary, and the
           ``ploidy`` argument can safely be removed as part of the process
           of updating from the msprime 0.x legacy API.

        :param io.IOBase output: The file-like object to write the VCF output.
        :param int ploidy: The ploidy of the individuals to be written to

        :param str contig_id: The value of the CHROM column in the output VCF.

            associated with sample nodes in the tree sequence.

            details and examples.

            individual columns in the VCF. In VCF nomenclature, these are the
            sample IDs. If specified, this must be a list of strings of
            length equal to the number of individuals to be output. Note that
            we do not check the form of these strings in any way, so that is
            is possible to output malformed VCF (for example, by embedding a
            tab character within on of the names). The default is to output
            ``tsk_j`` for the jth individual.
            See the :ref:`sec_export_vcf_individual_names` for examples
            and more information.
        :param position_transform: A callable that transforms the
            site position values into integer valued coordinates suitable for
            VCF. The function takes a single positional parameter x and must
            return an integer numpy array the same dimension as x. By default,
            this is set to ``numpy.round()`` which will round values to the
            nearest integer. If the string "legacy" is provided here, the
            pre 0.2.0 legacy behaviour of rounding values to the nearest integer
            (starting from 1) and avoiding the output of identical positions
            by incrementing is used.
            See the :ref:`sec_export_vcf_modifying_coordinates` for examples
            and more information.
        :param site_mask: A numpy boolean array (or something convertable to
            a numpy boolean array) with num_sites elements, used to mask out
            sites in the output. If  ``site_mask[j]`` is True, then this
            site (i.e., the line in the VCF file) will be omitted.
            See the :ref:`sec_export_vcf_masking_output` for examples
            and more information.
        :param sample_mask: A numpy boolean array (or something convertable to
            a numpy boolean array) with num_samples elements, or a callable
            that returns such an array, such that if
            ``sample_mask[j]`` is True, then the genotype for sample ``j``
            will be marked as missing using a ".". If ``sample_mask`` is a
            callable, it must take a single argument and return a boolean
            numpy array. This function will be called for each (unmasked) site
            with the corresponding :class:`.Variant` object, allowing
            for dynamic masks to be generated.

        :param bool isolated_as_missing: If True, the genotype value assigned to
            missing samples (i.e., isolated samples without mutations) is "."
            If False, missing samples will be assigned the ancestral allele.

        if this tree sequence has discrete genome coordinates and one or
        more sites. Inclusion of these sections can be controlled manually

        Tree topologies and branch lengths are listed
        sequentially in the TREES block and the spatial location of each tree
        encoded within the tree name labels. Specifically, a tree spanning
        the interval :math:`[x, y)`` is given the name ``f"t{x}^{y}"``

        By default, genome positions are printed out with with sufficient
        precision for them to be recovered exactly in double precision.
        If the tree sequence is defined on a :attr:`.discrete_genome`,

        of precision is used. Branch length precision defaults are handled

        If the ``precision`` argument is provided, genome positions and
        branch lengths are printed out with this many digits of precision.

        and two trees::

        If sequence data :meth:`.alignments` are defined for this tree sequence
        and there is at least one site present, sequence alignment data will also
        be included by default (this can be suppressed by setting

        .. note:: Note the default ``missing_data_character`` for this method
            is "?" rather then "N", in keeping with common conventions for
            nexus data. This can be changed using the ``missing_data_character``
            parameter.

        .. warning:: :ref:`Missing data<sec_data_model_missing_data>`
            is not supported for encoding tree topology information
            as our convention of using trees with multiple roots
            is not often supported by newick parsers. Thus, the method
            will raise a ValueError if we try to output trees with
            multiple roots. Additionally, missing data
            is not currently supported for alignment data.

        Returns a simplified tree sequence that retains only the history of

        original tree sequence, or :data:`tskit.NULL` (-1) if ``u`` is no longer
        present in the simplified tree sequence.

        In the returned tree sequence, the node with ID ``0`` corresponds to
        ``samples[0]``, node ``1`` corresponds to ``samples[1]`` etc., and all
        the passed-in nodes are flagged as samples. The remaining node IDs in
        the returned tree sequence are allocated sequentially in time order
        and are not flagged as samples.

        sequence will contain only topological information that is necessary to

        tree sequence, this will result in an output tree sequence with zero edges.
        When the number of sites is greater than zero, every tree in the output
        tree sequence will contain at least one site. For a given site, the
        topology of the tree containing that site will be identical

        in the input tree sequence.

        If ``filter_populations``, ``filter_individuals`` or ``filter_sites`` is
        True, any of the corresponding objects that are not referenced elsewhere
        are filtered out. As this is the default behaviour, it is important to
        realise IDs for these objects may change through simplification. By setting
        these parameters to False, however, the corresponding tables can be preserved

            allocated sequentially from zero. If False, the population table will
            not be altered in any way. (Default: True)
        :param bool filter_individuals: If True, remove any individuals that are
            not referenced by nodes after simplification; new individual IDs are
            allocated sequentially from zero. If False, the individual table will
            not be altered in any way. (Default: True)

        :param bool keep_unary_in_individuals: If True, preserve unary nodes
            that exist on the path from samples to root, but only if they are

        Returns a tree sequence containing only information directly
        referencing the provided list of nodes to retain.  The result will
        retain only the nodes whose IDs are listed in ``nodes``, only edges for
        which both parent and child are in ``nodes```, only mutations whose
        node is in ``nodes``, and only individuals that are referred to by one
        of the retained nodes.  Note that this does *not* retain
        the ancestry of these nodes - for that, see :meth:`.simplify`.

        This has the side effect of reordering the nodes, individuals, and
        populations in the tree sequence: the nodes in the new tree sequence
        will be in the order provided in ``nodes``, and both individuals and
        populations will be ordered by the earliest retained node that refers
        to them. (However, ``reorder_populations`` may be set to False
        to keep the population table unchanged.)

        By default, the method removes all individuals and populations not
        referenced by any nodes, and all sites not referenced by any mutations.
        To retain these unreferenced individuals, populations, and sites, pass
        ``remove_unreferenced=False``. If this is done, the site table will
        remain unchanged, unreferenced individuals will appear at the end of
        the individuals table (and in their original order), and unreferenced
        populations will appear at the end of the population table (unless

        Compute a windowed statistic from weights and a summary function.

        On each tree, this
        propagates the weights ``W`` up the tree, so that the "weight" of each
        node is the sum of the weights of all samples at or below the node.
        Then the summary function ``f`` is applied to the weights, giving a
        summary for each node in each tree. How this is then aggregated depends
        on ``mode``:

        "site"
            Adds together the total summary value across all alleles in each window.

        "branch"
            Adds together the summary value for each node, multiplied by the
            length of the branch above the node and the span of the tree.

        "node"
            Returns each node's summary value added across trees and multiplied
            by the span of the tree.

        Both the weights and the summary can be multidimensional: if ``W`` has ``k``
        columns, and ``f`` takes a ``k``-vector and returns an ``m``-vector,
        then the output will be ``m``-dimensional for each node or window (depending
        on "mode").

            unless ``strict=False``.  This is necessary for the statistic to be

        Compute a windowed statistic from sample counts and a summary function.
        This is a wrapper around :meth:`.general_stat` for the common case in
        which the weights are all either 1 or 0, i.e., functions of the joint
        allele frequency spectrum.
        See the :ref:`statistics interface <sec_stats_interface>` section for details on
        :ref:`sample sets <sec_stats_sample_sets>`,
        :ref:`windows <sec_stats_windows>`,
        :ref:`mode <sec_stats_mode>`,
        :ref:`span normalise <sec_stats_span_normalise>`,
        and :ref:`return value <sec_stats_output_format>`.
        If ``sample_sets`` is a list of ``k`` sets of samples, then
        ``f`` should be a function that takes an argument of length ``k`` and
        returns a one-dimensional array. The ``j``-th element of the argument
        to ``f`` will be the number of samples in ``sample_sets[j]`` that lie
        below the node that ``f`` is being evaluated for. See
        :meth:`.general_stat`  for more details.

        Here is a contrived example: suppose that ``A`` and ``B`` are two sets
        of samples with ``nA`` and ``nB`` elements, respectively. Passing these
        as sample sets will give ``f`` an argument of length two, giving the number
        of samples in ``A`` and ``B`` below the node in question. So, if we define


        .. code-block:: python

            def f(x):
                pA = x[0] / nA
                pB = x[1] / nB
                return np.array([pA * pB])

        then if all sites are biallelic,

        .. code-block:: python

            ts.sample_count_stat([A, B], f, 1, windows="sites", polarised=False, mode="site")

        would compute, for each site, the product of the derived allele
        frequencies in the two sample sets, in a (num sites, 1) array.  If
        instead ``f`` returns ``np.array([pA, pB, pA * pB])``, then the
        output would be a (num sites, 3) array, with the first two columns
        giving the allele frequencies in ``A`` and ``B``, respectively.

        .. note::
            The summary function ``f`` should return zero when given both 0 and
            the sample size (i.e., ``f(0) = 0`` and
            ``f(np.array([len(x) for x in sample_sets])) = 0``).  This is
            necessary for the statistic to be unaffected by parts of the tree
            sequence ancestral to none or all of the samples, respectively.

            Mean pairwise genetic diversity: the average over all n choose 2 pairs of
            sample nodes, of the density of sites at
            which the two carry different alleles, per unit of chromosome length.

            sample nodes and locations in the window, of the mean distance in
            the tree between the two samples (in units of time).

            and `J`, this computes `E[m(I,J) - m(I,S) - m(J,T) + m(S,T)]`.
            This can also be seen as the covariance of a quantitative trait
            determined by additive contributions from the genomes in each
            sample set. Let each allele be associated with an effect drawn from
            a `N(0,1/2)` distribution, and let the trait value of a sample set
            be the sum of its allele effects. Then, this computes the covariance
            between the trait values of two sample sets. For example, to
            compute covariance between the traits of diploid individuals, each
            sample set would be the pair of genomes of each individual; if
            ``proportion=True``, this then corresponds to :math:`K_{c0}` in
            `Speed & Balding (2014) <https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3821>`_.

        "branch"
            Total area of branches in the window ancestral to pairs of samples
            in two sample sets relative to the rest of the sample sets. To be
            precise, let `B(u,v)` denote the total area of all branches
            ancestral to nodes `u` and `v`, and let `B(I,J)` be the sum of
            `B(u,v)` over all nodes `u` in sample set `I` and `v` in sample set
            `J`. Let `S` and `T` be two independently chosen sample sets. Then
            for sample sets `I` and `J`, this computes
            `E[B(I,J) - B(I,S) - B(J,T) + B(S,T)]`.

        "node"
            For each node, the proportion of the window over which pairs of
            samples in two sample sets are descendants, relative to the rest of
            the sample sets. To be precise, for each node `n`, let `N(u,v)`
            denote the proportion of the window over which samples `u` and `v`
            are descendants of `n`, and let and let `N(I,J)` be the sum of
            `N(u,v)` over all nodes `u` in sample set `I` and `v` in sample set
            `J`. Let `S` and `T` be two independently chosen sample sets. Then
            for sample sets `I` and `J`, this computes

        the sample set but polymorphic in the entire set of samples. Please see
        the :ref:`sec_tutorial_afs_zeroth_entry` for an illustration.

        .. warning:: Please note that singletons are **not** counted in the initial
            entry in each AFS array (i.e., ``afs[0]``), but in ``afs[1]``.

        If ``sample_sets`` is None (the default), the allele frequency spectrum
        for all samples in the tree sequence is returned.

        If more than one sample set is specified, the **joint** allele frequency
        spectrum within windows is returned. For example, if we set
        ``sample_sets = [S0, S1]``, then afs[1, 2] counts the number of sites that
        are singletons within S0 and doubletons in S1. The dimensions of the
        output array will be ``[num_windows] + [1 + len(S) for S in sample_sets]``.

        If ``polarised`` is False (the default) the AFS will be *folded*, so that
        the counts do not depend on knowing which allele is ancestral. If folded,
        the frequency spectrum for a single sample set ``S`` has ``afs[j] = 0`` for
        all ``j > len(S) / 2``, so that alleles at frequency ``j`` and ``len(S) - j``
        both add to the same entry. If there is more than one sample set, the
        returned array is "lower triangular" in a similar way. For more details,
        especially about handling of multiallelic sites, see :ref:`sec_stats_notes_afs`.

        What is computed depends on ``mode``:

        "site"
            The number of alleles at a given frequency within the specified sample
            sets for each window, per unit of sequence length. To obtain the total
            number of alleles, set ``span_normalise`` to False.

        "branch"
            The total length of branches in the trees subtended by subsets of the
            specified sample sets, per unit of sequence length. To obtain the
            total, set ``span_normalise`` to False.

        "node"
            Not supported for this method (raises a ValueError).

        For example, suppose that `S0` is a list of 5 sample IDs, and `S1` is
        a list of 3 other sample IDs. Then `afs = ts.allele_frequency_spectrum([S0, S1],
        mode="site", span_normalise=False)` will be a 5x3 numpy array, and if
        there are six alleles that are present in only one sample of `S0` but
        two samples of `S1`, then `afs[1,2]` will be equal to 6.  Similarly,
        `branch_afs = ts.allele_frequency_spectrum([S0, S1], mode="branch",
        span_normalise=False)` will also be a 5x3 array, and `branch_afs[1,2]`
        will be the total area (i.e., length times span) of all branches that
        are above exactly one sample of `S0` and two samples of `S1`.

        Return the genealogical nearest neighbours (GNN) proportions for the given

        The GNN proportions for a focal node in a single tree are given by first finding
        the most recent common ancestral node :math:`a` between the focal node and any
        other node present in the reference sets. The GNN proportion for a specific

        :math:`a`, as a proportion of the total number of descendant nodes in any of the
        reference sets.

        For example, consider a case with 2 sample sets, :math:`S_1` and :math:`S_2`.
        For a given tree, :math:`a` is the node that includes at least one descendant in
        :math:`S_1` or :math:`S_2` (not including the focal node). If the descendants of
        :math:`a` include some nodes in :math:`S_1` but no nodes in :math:`S_2`, then the
        GNN proportions for that tree will be 100% :math:`S_1` and 0% :math:`S_2`, or
        :math:`[1.0, 0.0]`.

        For a given focal node, the GNN proportions returned by this function are an
        average of the GNNs for each tree, weighted by the genomic distance spanned by
        that tree.

        For an precise mathematical definition of GNN, see https://doi.org/10.1101/458067

        .. note:: The reference sets need not include all the samples, hence the most
            recent common ancestral node of the reference sets, :math:`a`, need not be
            the immediate ancestor of the focal node. If the reference sets only comprise
            sequences from relatively distant individuals, the GNN statistic may end up
            as a measure of comparatively distant ancestry, even for tree sequences that
            contain many closely related individuals.
